The task type is mental_rotation, and the example given is identifying the correct rotated version of a cube. The user wants a concise image description prompt that can be used for this purpose.\n\nFirst, I should recall what mental rotation entails. It's the ability to visualize how an object would look when rotated in space. So, the prompt should involve an object that can be rotated in different ways, and the test-taker has to choose the correct rotated version.\n\nThe example uses a cube, which is a good choice because cubes have symmetrical sides, making it easier to visualize rotations. However, to make the test more challenging or varied, maybe using a different shape could help. But the user also mentioned that optionally, a description of simple objects can be provided. So, perhaps I can stick with the cube unless another object is suggested.\n\nI need to make sure the prompt is clear and concise. It should specify that the object is a cube and describe how it's oriented in the original image. Then, the test-taker has to identify the correct rotated version from multiple options.\n\nWait, the example says \"Identify the correct rotated version of a cube.\" So", "iteration": 3}

Mental rotation tests how well someone can visualize an object from different angles. The example given is about identifying the correct rotated version of a cube, so the prompt should involve rotating a similar object.\n\nNext, the object description is a tiny sphere to the right of a green cube. I need to incorporate this into the prompt. The key is to describe the cube and sphere in a way that allows for mental rotation. I should specify the cube's color, size, and position relative to the sphere.\n\nI should also make the prompt clear and concise, so the test-taker knows exactly what to visualize. Including details like the sphere's color and position adds clarity. The goal is for the test-taker to rotate the object mentally and then identify the correct image from given options.\n\nPutting it all together, the prompt should clearly state the object's attributes and the task of mentally rotating it.

The task type is mental_rotation, which tests the ability to visualize how an object would look when rotated in space. The example given is identifying the correct rotated version of a cube, and the objects mentioned are a red cylinder above a blue mug.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a mental rotation test entails. It typically involves presenting an object in a certain orientation and then asking the test-taker to identify which of several options correctly represents that object after it has been rotated. The key here is that the test assesses the individual's spatial reasoning skills, their ability to manipulate and visualize objects in three dimensions.\n\nIn the provided example, the object is a cube, which is a straightforward shape, but the example also includes other elements (a red cylinder and a blue mug) arranged in a specific spatial relationship.
