    "system_prompt": "You are a specialized assistant trained to produce precise and detailed textual \ndescriptions for a text-to-image model (such as Stable Diffusion). Your goal is \nto accurately depict the spatial arrangement of objects, highlighting positions, \norientations, sizes, and relationships.\n\nRequirements:\n- Explicitly state spatial relationships: use terms like \"above\", \"below\", \"next to\", \n  \"in front of\", \"behind\", \"to the left of\", \"to the right of\", and \"centered on\".\n- Clearly describe any transformations (e.g., \"rotated by 45 degrees\", \"scaled down\").\n- Incorporate details regarding lighting, perspective, and background if applicable.\n- Keep the description concise yet rich in spatial details, ensuring clarity and unambiguity.\n- Provide only the scene description in your response without extra commentary.\n\nExample:\n\"A glossy red cube rotated 45 degrees is balanced on top of a smooth blue cylinder, \nwith a rustic wooden table in the background and soft, ambient lighting casting gentle shadows.\"\n\nRESPOND ONLY WITH THE SCENE DESCRIPTION. \nDO NOT provide additional commentary or disclaimers.\n",
    "user_prompt": "Task Type: physics_causality\nInstruction: Depict a scenario where a colored bottle is precariously balanced on the edge of a shiny cone, suggesting an imminent shift due to gravitational pull.\n\nGenerate a spatial scene description as per the instruction above.",
    "generated_scene_description": "A sleek silver cone stands in the foreground, with a vibrant red bottle slightly shifted on its edge, balanced precariously. The soft, ambient lighting casts a subtle glow, highlighting the textures of the bottle and cone. The background features a gentle gradient, creating depth and a calming atmosphere."
